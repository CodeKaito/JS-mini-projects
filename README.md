## 01-color-flipper

In this code we are using the function getRandomNumber to return a random value of the array hex or color.
Giving us a specific color assigned to that value, the background is changing as well.

## 02-counter

As every counter buttons, we simply initialize the "document.querySelector": whereas is the Document method that returns the first Element within the document that matches the specified selector, or group of selectors. If no matches are found, null is returned.
Assign the "addEventListener" to the class btn and target al the classList using the method "e.currentTarget" where e stays for "event".
